## What is this?

> A fully managed port of the [City Hash] hash algorithm in C#.

> CityHash is a family of non-cryptographic hash functions, designed for fast hashing of strings.

> Google developed the algorithm in-house starting in 2010.
> The C++ source code for the reference implementation of the algorithm was released 
> in 2011 under an MIT license, with credit to Geoff Pike and Jyrki Alakuijala.

## Notes

> - This library has a few adaptations to perform better using .net technology.
> - The 300 tests of the original library are working perfectly. Whoot!

## TODO

> - Port the CityHashCrc functions.

## Support

Honestly speaking, this port almost drove me nuts! :D 
The high level of the original code is awesome, and gave me a bit of work to do, but was fun.

As a human being I like to be honest, I believe that someday our kind will transcend money... 
But unfortunately, while we have not reached this day I need some money to make my living.
